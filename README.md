# 🔋 BatteryNotifier

A lightweight PowerShell utility that **notifies you when your laptop battery is fully charged** so you can unplug the charger and preserve battery health.

---

## ✅ Features

- Minimal, non-intrusive GUI alert when battery is full.
- Checks battery status every 5 seconds.
- Only reminds you if:
  - Charger is plugged in.
  - Battery reaches 100%.
  - It's been 5+ minutes since the last alert.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Written entirely in PowerShell using Windows Forms.
- Does not run in background when on battery power.
- GUI automatically exits when charger is unplugged.

## 💡 Why Use This?

Overcharging or consistently charging to 100% degrades battery health. Most laptops lack native alerts for full battery. This utility reminds you at the right time, quietly.
